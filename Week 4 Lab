I wake up today, feeling tired after a long week of college and slept in today. (I had things to do on friday)
I nearly forgot that I had a bunch of assignments for this class due the very next night.
I had to go and do some stuff today IRL as well so I only just get started on my assignments at 9 pm.
I watch the zoom video, copy all the slides into my folder for week 4, then realize 3 hours past by and now it's midnight on the day these assignments are due.
Great... 24 hours to basically do everything.

Task 1

Question 1:
What does DNS stand for?
Considering I see the question and the Answer on the same screen, I see that in Parenthesis on the very first sentence tells me the answer.
Domain Name System was the answer.

I just noticed that this was the ONLY question for task 1...

Task 2

Question 1:
What is the maximum length of a subdomain?
after reading the page, it told me that "63 characters" was the answer, but the format said "**".
Assuming the answer is only "63", I placed the answer and it was correct.

Question 2:
Which of the following characters cannot be used in a subdomain ( 3 b _ - )?
It told me that the hyphen was the only 1 that can't be used so I put a _ and it worked.
Yeah, an Underscore is not a hyphen but that's a woops on my part. It still counts as correct.

Question 3:
What is the maximum length of a domain name?
"the length must be kept to 253 characters or less" is in the 2nd to the last sentence of the page.


Question 4:
What type of TLD is .co.uk?
I looked and skimmed back the page and found that it would tell me that a cctld was used for geographical purposes and stated that .co.uk was there.

Task 3
Question 1: 
What type of record would be used to advise where to send email?
mx

Question 2:
What type of record handles IPv6 addresses?
aaaa
