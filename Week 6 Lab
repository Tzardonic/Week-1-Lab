I started today off by going to a video and listening to a man talk about how a handle feels good and doing "things" without actually being specific.  Most of the information given by this man barely had much information on the video and I made a notebook of all the information I COULD get from the video.

Notepad notes:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"Category 66 is used for voice, NEVER for network.

Category 110 is used in data.

110 blade is interchangable

66 is not unusual for daisy chaining

you do not need to trim the wire unless you have screwed terminals on jacks.

If you have a handle for a punch-down, slip in then turn the blade to lock it in place.

66 Blades are made in steel.

110 uses anodized coating.

66 blades can't be used on a jack.

Category 6 has the same type of punchdown to eachother.

The pick on a blue system can grab the wrong wire and it is cheaper.

The green handle has an extra storage slot for a spare blade.

Yellow blade can cut a wire's case if it spins twice, fast.

Always refer to pairs, not individual wires. (8 wires = 4 pairs)

Every pair is of a blue/orange/green/brown color and a white color wire.

White and Blue is the first pair.
White and Orange is the second pair.
White and Green is the third pair.
White and Brown is the fourth pair.

Pull a spare white string to pull down, which breaks the casing and can release the wires from their case.

Use linen scizzors.

Don't strip off the coating of 66 or 110.

higher category of wire = twist more.
B standards are most common in USA compared to A.
B should be on one and the other end."

as for the actual lab itself, we'll get into that.

As for the Theory: it was a simple read
https://gyazo.com/5c24af026a8e6a1a0b69ce296a1b02af

The pre-test only had 3 questions, I got the first question right but got the next 2 wrong.
I thought 10/100 meant 10 out of 100, not 100 on the 2nd question.
and the Theory only stated different devices, I wasn't aware it was specific.

The 3rd page was about Procedure
Again, another reading one

The Simulation can finally be started:
The first one was simple, I had to put all the words twice in a row since they go across from eachother.

The 2nd one was a pain on the other hand.
I did the typical order of Blue/White, Blue, Orange/White, Orange, Green/White, Green, and Brown/White, Brown.

after some trial and error on where to actually put the dang things, it kept telling me I was wrong despite the lab saying all of them are green.

The 3rd was back to being easy again, I just simply put the order in reverse.

again, it would tell me that I'm wrong but since the lab itself said green on all the points, I think it's right.


This week's lab was really short.
