Another week and another day I have barely any time to complete any work
I don't try to procrastinate but considering I have so much on my plate IRL and being too tired to do anything when I get home makes it difficult not to.
Asside from answering the automatically answered question, I simply get started.


Task 2

Question 1: Browse to the following website and ensure that you have opened your Developer Tools on AttackBox Firefox, or the browser on your computer. Using the Developer Tools, figure out the total number of questions.

Aside from doing a small little lab thing that made literally no sense to me, I counted the amount of questions after restarting the process again.
My answer was "8"


Task 3: I hate this Task now, please never give me it again.

I'm literally waiting 2 full minutes for this stupid program to start.
Then it starts making this stupid epileptic flashing on my screen. Give a warning first.
I literally couldn't handle this so I went to Edge instead and the answers weren't there except for question 4.
This Task infurated me.

Question 1: Which option would you use to set the size of the data carried by the ICMP echo request?
Google is my best friend here since the answer isn't found in this THM Lab
-s

Question 2: What is the size of the ICMP header in bytes?
Google is my best friend here since the answer also isn't found in this THM Lab.
8

Question 3: Does MS Windows Firewall block ping by default? (Y/N)
50% chance for it to be yes or no, I got it right the first time.
Y

Question 4: Deploy the VM for this task and using the AttackBox terminal, issue the command ping -c 10 MACHINE_IP. How many ping replies did you get back?
After so much issues with the stupid terminal, I got told 64 and put that as my answer but it was wrong.  I counted how many times the message got sent and it was 10.
10


Task 4:

Question 1: In Traceroute A, what is the IP address of the last router/hop before reaching tryhackme.com?
"172.67.69.208" No idea what else to say, it was at the very end of Traceroute A

Question 2: In Traceroute B, what is the IP address of the last router/hop before reaching tryhackme.com?
"104.26.11.229" No idea what else to say, it was at the very end of Traceroute A

Question 3: In Traceroute B, how many routers are between the two systems?
"26" considering that's the amount of routers counted in order, and the last router from Question 2 is attached to number 26.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The questions below are the reason I couldn't complete the lab in time.

Question 4: Check how many routers/hops are there between the AttackBox and the target VM.
Although this doesn't require me to answer it, I still counted 30.


Task 5

Question 1: What is the name of the running server?
I figured out I was using the wrong IP the entire time, I absolutely hate this VM.
You know... too bad they DON'T MAKE IT EASY to understand.
Apache

Question 2: What is the version of the running server (on port 80 of the VM)?
I figured out I was using the wrong IP the entire time, I absolutely hate this VM.
You know... too bad they DON'T MAKE IT EASY to understand.
2.4.10


Task 6

Question 1: Use Netcat to connect to the VM port 21. What is the version of the running server?
I figured out I was using the wrong IP the entire time, I absolutely hate this VM.
You know... too bad they DON'T MAKE IT EASY to understand.
0.17

The questions above are the reason I couldn't complete the lab in time.

Task 7:
Well this is just a summary, no questions here.
